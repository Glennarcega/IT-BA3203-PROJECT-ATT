### Introduction

Health research is necessary in order for doctors and scientists to better understand and improve health. Research plays an important role in learning how to prevent and treat illnesses and has the potential to help improve care for people around the world. The Importance of Health Research like privacy, health research has high value to society. It can provide important information about disease trends and risk factors, outcomes of treatment or public health interventions, functional abilities, patterns of care, and health care costs and use[1].
In the Philippines, the death rate is increasing every year. There are so many reasons why the rate continues to increase that if we consume it, it will have a huge impact on the country. One of these is the issue about Health. We know that health is one of the most important keys for us to be given a good and safe life, that our life can be comfortable with a simple compliance to our good. But if it is abused, it will be a great danger to our lives, it can also cause our body to suffer which may lead to death. This is the reason why health is a huge issue in everything, because it will also reflect in the statistics obtained by the Philippine Statistics Authority organizations that if the statistical data continues to climb in our country, it will have a big impact on identity.


The disease that goes to people is not only one there are many diseases that can enter a person, it can be spiritual, mental, sociological and physical. If a person is too weak to fight against these types of diseases it can be a big test regarding how to give a solution to this issue.

This kind of issue that the Philippines has is really disturbing because it is serious and has never been given a cure. By these we can better measure the rates every year and thus be informed about the state of deaths caused by the Health Issues. With the help of the organization, they are able to determine every part of the Philippines whether Provincial or Regional so it is easier to notice and study this issue to reduce the number of deaths in our country.

[3]. According to the Philippines Statistics Authority, the reported deaths in 2017 reached 579,237, a decrease of 0.5 percent than the previous year’s 582,183 deaths. This is equivalent to a crude death rate (CDR) of 5.5, or about six (6) persons per thousand population. In 2017, an average of 1,587 persons died daily. This translates to 66 deaths per hour or one (1) per minute. The number of deaths from 2008 to 2016 showed an increasing trend but slightly declined in 2017. The increase during the ten-year period is about a quarter, or 25.5 percent, from 461,581 in 2008 to 579,237 in 2017[3]..

To sum up, this analysis focuses on SDG 3, which is good health and well-being. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the highest cause of death in a specific region in the Philippines. The dataset is from the Philippine Statistic Authority, which will conduct the analysis to procure the required yearly changes from 2006–2017. This study will be evidence of whether Filipinos will truly care about themselves.

### Problem Statement
Identifying the highest cases of death in a specific region and raising awareness to avoid the disease.
### Significance of the Study
Health effects (or health impacts) are changes in health resulting from exposure to a source. Health effects are an important consideration in many areas, such as hygiene, pollution studies, occupational safety and health, ([nutrition]), and health sciences in general. Some of the major environmental sources of health effects are air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, noise pollution, and over-illumination.
This research will assist individuals and society by allowing them to raise awareness and prevent disease. This initiative allows the community to gather information and will assist them in gaining more awareness.
### Methods
Studies on health and the rising death rate in the Philippines have added to the available empirical evidence and deepened our understanding of the subject. Therefore, carrying out empirical research is a suitable method for advancing and investigating new research. In order to draw a conclusion and offer better guidance, this concentrates on doing an analysis of information in the Philippines. Additionally, it will show the typical trend of death causes.
### Expected Output
Prior to making any assumptions, the project's objective is to identify the broad pattern in the data that will aid the researcher. When the analysis's findings are established and show a correlation between various factors, as well as when those findings are deteriorating, they can be utilized to disseminate preventative measures to lower the probability of dying from that cause. It can also aid in future research to develop a strong strategic plan.
